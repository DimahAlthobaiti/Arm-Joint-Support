# Arm Joint Support – Structural Reinforcement

This part represents a **joint mount** section of a robotic arm, designed to support the elbow-like rotating mechanism.  
The geometry is constrained by fixed requirements such as:
- **Wall thickness:** 5mm 
- **Base diameter and area:** fixed at Ø55mm
- **Hole-to-base vertical distance:** 29mm

## Reinforcement Modifications

### 1. Increased Base Thickness
- **Original:** 10mm  
- **Modified:** 13mm  
- **Why?** This improves structural stiffness and better distributes mechanical loads from the side walls into the base.
- **Impact:** Enhanced stability without affecting overall footprint.

### 2. Filleted Circular Hole Edge
- A **reinforcing ring** was added around the main shaft hole to protect against localized stress.
- A **smooth fillet** (circular rounding) was applied at the transition between the hole and surrounding material.
- **Why?** Prevents micro-cracking and improves stress flow around the rotating axis.

---

### 3. Internal and External Base-to-Wall Fillets
- Fillets were applied where vertical side walls meet the base from both **inside and outside**.
- **Why?** Sharp corners concentrate stress; fillets reduce these concentrations, preventing cracking and delamination in printed parts.

---

### 4. Top Edge Wall Fillets
- The top edge of both vertical walls was rounded with **10mm radius fillets**.
- **Why?** Reduces edge fragility and crack initiation during repeated loading or rotation.
- Enhances both strength and print quality.
